## Page Behavior

### Initial Load

When the user management screen is initially loaded, the table should display a list of all users in the system. The table should be sorted by user ID in ascending order.

### Adding a User
To add a user, the administrator should click the "Add User" button. This will display the form for adding a user. The administrator should enter the required information into the form and click the "Submit" button. If the email address is already in use, an error message should be displayed, and the administrator should be prompted to enter a different email address. If all the required information is entered correctly, the new user should be added to the system, and the table should be updated to include the new user.

### Editing a User
To edit a user, the administrator should click the "Edit" button next to the user they wish to edit. This will display the form for editing a user. The administrator should update the user's information as needed and click the "Submit" button. If the email address is already in use by another user, an error message should be displayed, and the administrator should be prompted to enter a different email address. If all the required information is entered correctly, the user's information should be updated in the system, and the table should be updated to reflect the changes.

### Deleting a User
To delete a user, the administrator should click the "Delete" button next to the user they wish to delete. A confirmation dialog should be displayed, asking the administrator to confirm that they wish to delete the user. If the administrator confirms, the user should be deleted from the system, and the table should be updated to reflect the changes.
